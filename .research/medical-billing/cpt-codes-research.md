# CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) Codes Research

## Overview
CPT codes are maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA) and are used to report medical, surgical, and diagnostic procedures and services.

## Code Structure
- Format: 5-digit numeric codes
- Categories:
  - Category I: Procedures and services (10000-99999)
  - Category II: Performance measurement tracking codes (0001F-9999F)
  - Category III: Emerging technology codes (0016T-XXXXT)
- Modifiers: 2-digit codes that provide additional information

## Update Process
- Updated annually by AMA
- Effective date: January 1st each year
- Public comment period before changes

## Common Errors
1. Upcoding: Using higher-paying codes than justified
2. Unbundling: Separating components that should be bundled
3. Incorrect modifier usage
4. Using expired codes

## Data Sources
- AMA CPT Codebook (official print resource)
- AMA CPT API (subscription-based)
- CMS resources for Medicare-specific guidance
- Third-party code databases (need AMA license)

## Implementation Considerations
- License required for AMA CPT codes
- Real-time updates needed for accuracy
- Integration with EHR/EMR systems
- Cross-referencing with ICD-10 for medical necessity
